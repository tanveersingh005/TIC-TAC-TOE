# TIC-TAC-TOE
Welcome to my first project on GitHub! This repository contains a simple yet functional Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates basic web development skills, including layout creation with HTML, styling with CSS, and interactivity with JavaScript.

Features
1.Two-player mode: Play against another person on the same device.
2. Dynamic UI updates: The game board updates in real-time as players take turns.
3.Win detection: The game detects when a player has won and highlights the winning combination.
4.Reset functionality: Players can reset the game board to start a new game.
